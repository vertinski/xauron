### Remote Desktop Streaming App 

<br/>

‚úÖ Live-stream Your desktop to any web browser (smartphones included)

‚úÖ Work on a remote machine from anywhere with internet access

‚úÖ JSON data transfer using dedicated API (encryption in works rn!)

‚úÖ Embed the stream in Your blog or any other website, bc it's a dynammic IMG element

<br/>

> Web page is served on port 8888, and API is open at port 8000  
> Both visible on local network (LAN) unless configured and routed otherwise.  

<br/>

‚ö†Ô∏è Web page and API are accessible to anyone in local network for now! Needs access rules and network management. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Ongoing active development on stream encryption, needs to be implemented asap.
