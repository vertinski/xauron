### Remote Desktop Streaming App 

<br/>

✅ Live-stream Your desktop to any web browser (smartphones included)

✅ Work on a remote machine from anywhere with internet access

✅ JSON data transfer using dedicated API (encryption in works rn!)

✅ Embed the stream in Your blog or any other website, bc it's a dynamic IMG element

✅ Added stream scrambling functionality

<br/>

> Web page is served on port 8888, and API is open at port 8000  
> Both visible on local network (LAN) unless configured and routed otherwise.  
> Default stream scrambling key is 'testkey' and is stored in txt_key.txt file

<br/>

⚠️ Web page and API are accessible to anyone in local network for now! Needs access rules and network management. 

⚠️ Ongoing development on stream encryption. For now only simple scrambling is enabled. Change the default key!
