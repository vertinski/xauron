### Remote Desktop Streaming App 

<br/>

✅ Live-stream Your desktop to any web browser (smartphone included)

✅ Work on a remote machine from anywhere with internet access

✅ JSON data transfer using dedicated API (encryption in works rn!)

<br/>
<br/>

⚠️ Web page and API are accessible to anyone in local network for now! Needs access rules and network management. 

⚠️ Ongoing active development on stream encryption, needs to be implemented asap.
